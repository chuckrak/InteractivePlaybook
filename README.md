# InteractivePlaybook
Learn a football playbook in an interactive manner.

## Program Explanation:
When the program is run, it generates a football field with two defensive ends near the bottom of the screen. These Defensive Ends should be displayed as “E”. They can be moved around with the arrow keys on the keyboard. A formation and play will be automatically generated and you will immediately be able to move the two ends around with the arrow keys, using the 'Switch Player' button to change control from one to another. Each movement is considered to be one yard. Use this one-yard-per-press to correctly align given the formation and play call, and click the 'Check Alignment' button to confirm correct positioning. If stuck, click 'I give up!' and the correct positioning will be revealed. To start a new play, click 'New Play'.

## Additional Features
'Alignment' can be used to change the shade of the player to a left or right shade, or head up.
Use the 'DELETE & enter offensive formation' Text Field and 'Check Offensive Formation' buttons to test knowledge of the offensive formations.
'Average Time' will tell you the average time it takes you to solve each problem.

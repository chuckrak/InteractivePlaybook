# InteractivePlaybook
Learn a football playbook in an interactive manner.

##Program Explanation:
When the program is run, it generates a football field with two defensive ends near the bottom of the screen. These Defensive Ends should be displayed as “E”. They can be moved around with the arrow keys on the keyboard. A formation and play will be automatically generated and you will immediately be able to move the two ends around with the arrow keys, using the “Switch Player” button to change control from one to another. Every time an arrow key is pressed, you move one yard in that direction. You should then be able to use this one-yard-per-press to correctly align yourself given the formation and play call. To change the shade of the defensive player from head up to inside or outside, click the button that says “Alignment… click to change”. Once you have aligned in the correct place click the “New Play” button to make another play.

##What Should Happen:
You should be able to move the players to the correct spots, click the “Check Alignment” button, and it should tell you whether or not the players are in the correct spots. If they are in the correct spots and the program tells you they are not, please record this in the error log spreadsheet. You should also be able to make an out call if it is warranted. There is currently no support in the program for Under Wide at the moment, so this should not be generated as a play call.
